## About The Project

This program is written in Java and utilizes the Processing 3 sketchbook software. Processing 3 is basically an application that provides easy access to creating visuals using ordinary programming languages like Java. It really is an incredible tool for learning and visualizing various topics. I had not used this sketchbook software before so I decided to recreate an array sorting visualization program. I had seen examples of array sorting visualizations on youtube and thought they looked really interesting. So I thought, why not just recreate the program myself? My program currently only shows an example of selection sort, but it can be expanded more in the future for different types of sorting.

## Executing The Program

To run the program you can simply copy and paste my Java code into the Processing 3 sketchbook. Or you can just import it.

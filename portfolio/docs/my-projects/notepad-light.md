## About The Project

One weekend I was very bored and wanted to understand how to create GUI applications with C++. After searching online a bit I found the easiest way was to use a cross-platform graphical framework called Qt. When deciding what to make I figured I would recreate notepad from Windows without any special features like zooming, word wrapping, etc. 

#### File features:
* New File
* Open file
* Save
* Save File

#### Edit features:
* Copy
* Paste
* Cut
* Undo
* Redo

## Executing The Program

Below are some example images of the running program. Not a whole lot to look at because its basically just a simple text editor, but you can at least see what it looks like.

## About The Project

Project Viznet is a neural network visualization program that is still a work in progress. However, a lot of the basic functionality is working. The program basically allows you to train a network to differentiate between blue and red flowers. It allows you to manually input points on a graph and visualize the search space, error, and even modify the neural network architecture using a text editor. This allows you to play around with the various parameters of the neural network and experiment with different architectures to see how the network learning changes. Personally I think its the coolest program I have worked on thus far. For a demo of the application please check out the video below. I explain a lot more about how the program works. Unfortunately the codebase for the program, which is written entirely in python using Qt, is a bit of a hot mess. Therefore, I don't have the code publicly available on github yet. But I hope to find the time to revise this program and distribute a self contained version.
